## Overview
This project presents a **real-time adaptive reactive control framework** for **pre-contact safety** in **Human–Robot Interaction (HRI)** using a **bendable capacitive proximity sensor** mounted on a manipulator.  
A key goal is to detect nearby objects **before contact** and trigger **reactive safety behaviors** in real time.

## Motivation (HRI Safety Gap)
Conventional safety sensing has limitations for pre-contact HRI:
- **Tactile/force sensors** detect state changes **after contact**
- **Vision sensors** may suffer from occlusion and blind spots in collaborative environments :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

This work targets a practical, robot-mounted sensing layer that supports **pre-contact perception** and **immediate safety intervention**.

## Sensor Design: Bendable Capacitive Proximity Sensor
### 1) Bendable mounting via kerf-pattern electrode
Each capacitive sensing layer uses a **kerf pattern** so the same sensor can be mounted on both **flat and curved robot surfaces** without redesign. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

### 2) Dual-sensor fusion for distance estimation (Capacitive + ToF)
Capacitive sensing provides near-field sensitivity and wide FoV, but its distance relationship is **nonlinear**.  
To address this, a ToF sensor is fused to **linearize/denoise** the distance estimate using an exponential model:

- Model fitting:  \( X = a \cdot e^{bY} \)
- Distance inference:  \( Y = \frac{1}{b}(\ln X - \ln a) \)

where \(X\) is capacitive measurement and \(Y\) is distance. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

### 3) Embedded processing + CAN streaming
Signals are preprocessed on the **MCU** and transmitted via **CAN** to the robot software stack (ROS). :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

## Real-Time Control Architecture (CAN → ROS → Safety Logic)
The control pipeline is:
1. Robot executes a planned trajectory (quintic polynomial trajectory planning)
2. Proximity distance is streamed via CAN and monitored in ROS
3. **Safety State Logic** compares distance to thresholds
4. If the condition is satisfied, it **cancels active trajectory goals** and stops the robot (E-stop) :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}

This architecture provides a practical safety layer and is designed to be extendable to distance-keeping / reactive obstacle behaviors. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}

---

## Experimental Validation (Real Robot)
Experiments with quintic-polynomial trajectories show that when an obstacle approaches the sensor:
- The **E-stop flag** is triggered by the distance threshold
- **Joint velocities rapidly converge to zero** :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11} :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}

## Future Work
- Extend the safety layer from **Emergency Stop** to **continuous avoidance / distance-keeping control** :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}
- Improve robustness for deployment (sensor mounting stability, wiring/noise, real-world repeatability)
